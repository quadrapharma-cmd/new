# Dossier Builder for EDA — engine (phase P0)

The design lives in `docs/ctd/design/`: `01-PLAN.md`, `02-LOGIC.md`, `03-UX.md`, and the prototype.

This folder is the code skeleton. It is kept here until the separate repository (`eda-dossier-builder`, decision D5) exists, and it touches nothing in Drugbox.

## What works now (P0)

| Part | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Rule pack | `rulepacks/eda.ctd.nta065.v5/` | 101 requirements (M1–M5) from NP.CAPP.065 v5 + the CTD Quality guideline v2. Each one carries: the matrix cell verbatim (I / G-Imp / G-Loc), an `applies` condition, a document class, the source, and a provenance tag |
| Schema | `rulepacks/schema/requirement.schema.json` | JSON Schema for a requirement record |
| Expression language | `engine/dossier_engine/expr.py` | Safe boolean conditions (`and/or/not/in/==`). Parsed and never executed: no calls, no attributes |
| Profile | `engine/dossier_engine/profile.py` | The product facts. Blocks contradictions with a bilingual message (local + imported bulk, toll + imported, Rolling after 01/12/2026, biological, duplicate API) |
| eCTD placement | `requirements.yaml` → `ectd.nodes` | Each requirement is mapped to its node: `m1/eg` from the provisional profile, M2–M5 from the ICH DTD (tested) |
| Resolver | `engine/dossier_engine/resolver.py` | profile + pack → slots (R / O / NR / NA). Each slot gives a reason and a source. Slots are expanded per API manufacturer (CEP / DMF / FULL). `diff()` reports what a profile change adds or removes |
| CLI | `tools/resolve.py` | Prints the requirements board for a profile |

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m pytest -q tests                                  # 50+ tests
python3 tools/resolve.py examples/examplol.yaml             # required items
python3 tools/resolve.py examples/examplol.yaml --all --lang ar   # with the reasons, Arabic
```

## Rules for editing the pack

- **The YAML is the source of truth.** `tools/xlsx_to_pack.py` was used once to bootstrap the pack from `docs/ctd/checklist/EDA-eCTD-Company-Checklist.xlsx`.
- `tests/test_pack_vs_checklist.py` keeps the pack and the checklist in agreement: same ids and titles, matrix cells verbatim. An unconditional item must resolve to the matrix level.
- Any logic beyond the matrix is labelled `logic_provenance`. An engineering assumption (e.g. S.2.2–2.6 and S.3.2 «covered by CEP») is tagged `ASSUMPTION` and shows ⚑ in the UI until it is confirmed.

## Next (P0 → P1)

The provisional EG profiles are in `docs/ctd/ectd/EG-PROVISIONAL-PROFILE-v0/` (eCTD 3.2.2) and `…-v4-v0/` (eCTD 4.0). After them come the pack of checks (`checks.yaml`), the folder map per output (`folders.yaml`), and the three writers: CTD, eCTD 3.2.2 and eCTD 4.0.
